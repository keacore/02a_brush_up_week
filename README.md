# #2a Brush Up Week
### Exercise for the "No teachings, but do these tutorials and exercises" day

This week there is no formal teachings, but instead you should use the time on getting up to date with a few topics you have been woorking with somewhere in the last 3 semesters of your education.

The reason why you should be able to use these topics is that  we will work with these technologies a lot this semester, and there is not any dirrect teachings in this (since you already have had these teachings on 2nd or 3rd semester).

The areas you should look into is:

1. HTML & CSS
2. Git & GitHub
3. C# syntax exercises (this one is new, but it is almost like Java)    

## HTML & CSS
In order for you to follow this elective (and many of the other electives on CS to) you should have some basic knowlege about html5 & css. This elective will build on this knowlege, so it is a good idea to look a bit into this.    

My suggestion is that you look at the tutorials on [w3school.org](http://www.w3schools.com)    
* [html](http://www.w3schools.com/html/)
* [css](http://www.w3schools.com/css/)    
And then do these [exercises](xxx). If you can do this you are "on track" and could be happy :)
