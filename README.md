# Brush Up Week
Exercise for the "No teachings, but do these tutorials and exercises" day

This week there is no formal teachings, but instead you should use the time on getting up to date with a few topics you have been woorking with somewhere in the last 3 semesters of your education.

The reason why you should be able to use these topics is that  we will work with these technologies a lot this semester, and there is not any dirrect teachings in this (since you already have had these teachings on 2nd or 3rd semester).

The areas yu should look into is:

1. HTML & CSS
2. Git & GitHub
3. C# syntax exercises (this one is new, but it is almost like Java)
