# #2a Brush Up Week
### Exercise for the "No teachings, but do these tutorials and exercises" day

This week there is no formal teachings, but instead you should use the time on getting up to date with a few topics you have been woorking with somewhere in the last 3 semesters of your education.

The reason why you should be able to use these topics is that  we will work with these technologies a lot this semester, and there is not any dirrect teachings in this (since you already have had these teachings on 2nd or 3rd semester).    

**You will be needing theese skills next week when you do the first mandatory assignment.**

The areas you should look into is:

1. HTML & CSS
2. Git & GitHub
3. C# syntax exercises (this one is new, but it is almost like Java)    

## HTML & CSS
In order for you to follow this elective (and many of the other electives on CS to) you should have some basic knowlege about html & css. This elective will build on this knowlege, so it is a good idea to look a bit into this.    

My suggestion is that you look at the tutorials on [w3school.org](http://www.w3schools.com)    
* [html](http://www.w3schools.com/html/)
* [css](http://www.w3schools.com/css/)    
And then do these 
* [exercises](xxx). 

If you can do this you are "on track" and should be happy :)

## Git and GitHub
On your Second Semester you learned about Git, and you where using Github or Bitbucket for your online Repositories. In this Elective we will also be using git, and therefor you should be up to date.    
* You should go through these [tutorials](xxx).     
<small>(These tutorials uses Bitbucket for its online repositories, you are welcome to use Github if you want).</small>      

If you fell that you can master these tutorials you are "on track" and should be happy :)

## C# exercises
C# is the language used in an Asp.Net Core application.    
You should be familiar with this language before we start on our MVC ASP.NET Core projects.    
The good thing is that it is almost identical to Java, so the task of learning this language is not so big.

You should complete these 
* [tutorials](https://www.microsoft.com/net/tutorials/csharp/getting-started) <small>(until the [Understanding Namespaces](https://www.microsoft.com/net/tutorials/csharp/getting-started/namespaces))</small>.     

The rest of the tutorials will come later.
